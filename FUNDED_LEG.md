# PropFund — Funded Leg & Performance Scaling (Design Spec)

> Status: **proposal — for sign-off before contract changes.** Branch: `feat/funded-leg-scaling`.
> This document specifies turning PropFund's *funded* phase from a virtual construct into
> real, performance-scaled capital deployed on an on-chain perp venue, and the economics
> ($1 eval) that the scaling model makes safe.

## 1. Motivation

Today PropFund has two phases, both fully virtual:

- **Eval** — synthetic `virtualBalance *= spot/entry`, priced off Pyth, 1× long-only, no real capital.
- **Funded** — `openTrade` moves USDC *inside the pool* (`PropFund.sol:1017`) priced off Pyth. Still virtual: no external position exists anywhere.

The goal of this work is to keep the eval virtual (its strength — zero custody risk while proving skill)
and make the **funded leg real**: a passing trader's signal is mirrored into an actual leveraged
perp position, capital scaling up with proven performance and down with losses.

## 2. Venue decision

Per the venue research (see commit notes), the funded leg targets **Base** to keep gas a fraction of a
fraction (sub-cent), and stays **Pyth-native** end-to-end so the funded price process matches the eval.

| | Primary | Runner-up | Rejected |
|---|---|---|---|
| Venue | **Avantis (Base)** | **Synthetix Perps V3 (Base)** | GMX (Arb/Chainlink), Gains (Chainlink/EOA), Hyperliquid/Drift/Aevo (own L1s), Vertex (off-chain sequencer), Aave-loop (high gas, no funding) |
| Oracle | Pyth Pro + Chainlink | Pyth (SIP-285) | — |
| Exec | **Atomic** single-tx `openTrade{value: execFee}(...)` | Async `commitOrder` → keeper settle | — |
| Why | Maps 1:1 to our atomic-router pattern; simplest accounting | Cross-margin, NFT account a contract can own, 20% integrator fee rebate | — |

**Decision:** build the adapter interface generic; ship **Avantis** first (atomic execution matches the
existing `PropFundRouter` pattern). Keep Synthetix V3 as a second adapter once the interface is proven.

### Adapter boundary
The funded leg is an **optional adapter behind a stable interface** — `PropFund` stays synthetic by
default; a `IFundedVenue` adapter (`AvantisAdapter`, later `SynthetixV3Adapter`) is wired in only when
real trading is enabled. This preserves the current clean design boundary and lets us deploy on Base
**testnet first**, mainnet only when ready.

```solidity
interface IFundedVenue {
    function openPosition(uint8 assetId, uint256 collateral, bool isLong, uint8 leverage, uint64 tp, uint64 sl)
        external payable returns (bytes32 positionKey);
    function closePosition(bytes32 positionKey) external payable returns (int256 realizedPnl);
    function positionPnl(bytes32 positionKey) external view returns (int256);
}
```

> Note: Avantis charges funding rates, dynamic hourly fees, spread, and **caps max profit per position**.
> These are real frictions on the funded capital (gas is ~free, trading frictions are not). The adapter
> surfaces them so internal PnL accounting reflects venue reality, not the frictionless eval.

## 3. Eval-fee economics

**Eval fee = $1** (token amount; configurable). What it does — and explicitly does *not* — do:

- ✅ **Covers operating cost** — eval is virtual + sub-cent Base gas; $1 is 100×+ the real per-eval cost.
- ✅ **Sybil / brute-force tax** — on a permissionless chain a free eval invites bots retrying until
  variance flukes a pass. The eval is hard to fluke (+8% over ≥3 trades, ≤5% drawdown), so expected
  attempts-to-fluke is high and $1×attempts is a real deterrent.
- ❌ **Does NOT subsidize funding losses.** At a 10% pass rate, $1 fees back only ~$10 per funded account —
  trivial vs. capital at risk. **The funded leg must therefore be self-sustaining on its own** (drawdown
  stop + profit split + integrator rebates), independent of eval-fee revenue.

**What makes $1 safe:** the scaling model in §4. A fluke pass yields a *tiny* starting account; meaningful
capital is unlocked only by sustained, rule-abiding real performance. The attacker can't convert one lucky
pass into a payday.

## 4. Performance scaling model (the core)

Funding scales **up** with proven performance + rule adherence, **down** with losses. Bidirectional.

### 4.1 Current state & the one contradiction
`_leverageLevel(cumulativePnl)` already derives a tier from lifetime realized PnL:

| cumulative PnL | tier |
|---|---|
| baseline | 2× |
| ≥ +$50 | 3× |
| ≥ +$150 | 5× |
| ≥ +$400 | 8× |
| ≥ +$1000 | 10× |

This curve is bidirectional **in spirit** (pure function of `cumulativePnl`), but the trade gate uses
`f.lastLevel`, which **only ratchets up** (`PropFund.sol:996` — "once earned, the tier sticks even after a
drawdown"). A trader who spikes to 10× then bleeds keeps 10×. **This directly contradicts "scales down
with losses."**

### 4.2 Change 1 — live-tier gating (bidirectional)
Gate trades on the **live** `_leverageLevel(cumulativePnl)` instead of the ratcheted `lastLevel`. A losing
trader is automatically demoted the moment cumulative PnL falls through a threshold — no new machinery.
Keep `lastLevel` **only** for achievement NFT mints (so "reached level 8" still mints), never for risk.

### 4.3 Change 2 — scale the capital, not just leverage
Today allocation (`f.deposit`) is static; only leverage scales. Real prop scaling grows the *funded
amount*. Tie the effective allocation cap to the same live tier:

```
allocation A = baseAllocation × tierMultiplier(cumulativePnl)
```

Funding and leverage both scale off one proven metric, both directions. Bigger A → bigger absolute payouts
(trader's split of profit on a bigger base). Losses shrink A → smaller pool risk → self-correcting.

### 4.4 Change 3 — rule-adherence promotion gate
Scaling **up** requires rule adherence, not just a lucky PnL print. Enforced conditions:

- Never breached the max-drawdown stop (5%/level floor).
- Respected per-trade margin cap and mandatory TP/SL.
- Minimum N closed trades at the current tier before promotion (no single-trade jumps).
- Hard-rule break (drawdown breach) → **demote a tier or terminate funding**, not just pause.

### 4.5 End-to-end lifecycle
1. Pass virtual eval (pay $1) → funded at **tier 2, small base allocation** (fluke-safe).
2. Trade real on Avantis, sized off `A × tier`, drawdown-stopped.
3. Sustained profit + clean record → `cumulativePnl` climbs → tier + allocation step up → bigger payouts.
4. Losses → `cumulativePnl` falls → tier + allocation step **down** automatically.
5. Drawdown breach → demote / terminate.

## 4.6 Unit economics (simulated — `analysis/funded_economics.py`)

Monte Carlo of the funded-account lifecycle. The pool keeps `(1−split)` of winning trades but eats
**100%** of losers, so for a zero-edge trader the pool is negative — the model only works if eval
*selection* produces edge, amplified by scaling and a tiered split. Two structural rules are load-bearing:

1. **Payout only on net new high-water profit** (losses must be recovered first). Paying per-winning-trade
   leaks badly — it dropped break-even from a 30 bps/trade required edge to 20 bps just by fixing this.
2. **Tiered split** — pool keeps more of unproven traders' early profit, less as they scale:
   tier 2 → 50/50, tier 3 → 60/40, tier 5 → 70/30, tier 8 → 80/20, tier 10 → 85/15.
   This drops the **break-even trader edge to ~9.3 bps/trade** — a realistic bar for a cohort that had to
   clear a +8%/≤5%-drawdown eval.

Pool EV per funded account (incl. $1 eval fee, 8% pass rate → $12.50 fee-buffer/account):

| trader edge/trade | pool $/acct (trading) | + eval fee | ruin % |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| 0.00% | −19.28 | −6.78 | 100% |
| **+0.10%** | −11.66 | **+0.88** | 99.8% |
| +0.20% | +4.99 | +17.49 | 97.5% |
| +0.30% | +47.93 | +60.43 | 86.2% |

- **Break-even ≈ +0.10%/trade edge.** Below it the pool bleeds (slowly, bounded); above it the pool compounds.
- At +0.10%, the **$1 eval fee covers 107%** of the per-account trading loss — so near break-even the eval
  fee is exactly the tipping factor. (At a *harder* eval / lower pass rate, the per-funded fee buffer grows.)
- **Ruin ≈ 100%** is by design: the drawdown stop trails the high-water, so every account eventually
  retraces and stops — but loss is bounded at `dd × allocation` and the pool has already banked its share.
  *Open decision:* trailing-HWM stop (pool-favorable, every trader eventually stops) vs. a fixed floor
  (winners survive indefinitely, better trader UX). See §7.

### Capacity / waitlist (capital is the bottleneck, not eval throughput)
Finite pool `K`; funded allocations must sum ≤ `K`; passed traders queue **FIFO** until capital frees
(ruin / graduation / scale-down). Scaling a winner **up competes for the same capital** as funding the next
queued passer — the queue arbitrates. PropFund already has this FIFO + fair-pool-partition
(`QueueAndExpiry.t.sol`); this work makes scaling a first-class claimant on it.

Simulated (K varied, demand = 1 passer/tick, blended eval-selected cohort):

| pool K | utilization | avg wait | funded | queue@end | ROI |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| $3,000 | 97% | 648 ticks | 293 | 1,697 | 992% |
| $8,000 | 97% | 589 ticks | 750 | 1,248 | 449% |
| $20,000 | 95% | 188 ticks | 1,521 | 434 | 265% |
| $50,000 | 49% | ~0 ticks | 2,048 | 0 | 120% |

**The waitlist trade-off:** scarce capital → near-100% utilization + sky-high ROI-on-capital, but long
queues (bad trader UX — passers wait a long time). Abundant capital → no wait, lower capital efficiency.
The pool operator sizes `K` (and a max-allocation ceiling) to balance trader experience against capital
efficiency. Fast account turnover (the ~100% trailing-stop ruin) is what keeps capital recycling and waits
short at moderate `K`.

## 4.7 Copy-trading layer — DAO + side capital (marketplace)

Beyond the core pool's allocation, a **DAO treasury and external depositors can auto-copy proven funded
traders with additional, independent capital.** This makes PropFund two-sided: traders bring skill; pool +
DAO + copiers bring capital; proven signals get amplified instead of queued.

**Why it fits the model:**
- **Relieves the waitlist (§4.6).** Copy capital is opt-in and *separate from `K`*, so the best traders
  absorb more capital without the core pool over-allocating or pushing new passers down the FIFO queue.
- **Isolates risk.** Copiers bear their **own** losses on their **own** capital — the LP pool is never
  liable for copier drawdowns. So the copy layer is pure fee + volume upside to the protocol, not new
  pool risk.
- **Tier-gated by the same engine.** Copy-eligibility requires a minimum tier / clean drawdown record —
  the `cumulativePnl` track record that already gates allocation. Fluke passers can't attract side capital.

**Mechanism.** When a copy-eligible trader's signal fires, the router opens the lead position *and* the
copier positions **atomically in one tx** (same `IFundedVenue` adapter, proportional size) — so copiers
get the same fill, no signal-leak slippage. The DAO sets per-trader copy caps, eligibility tier, and risk
limits via governance.

**Fee waterfall (per copy profit):** trader performance fee → protocol/DAO fee → LP/treasury → integrator
rebate on the (now larger) volume. The trader earns *on top of* their pool split, sharpening the incentive
to follow rules as their copied AUM grows. (Exact split = open decision, §7.)

**New binding constraint — venue capacity, not pool `K`.** Copy capital amplifies position size on the perp
venue, so the limit becomes the venue's **open-interest caps, per-position profit caps, and market impact**
(Avantis caps max profit per position; both venues have OI limits and liquidity bounds). A trader with a
$250 base alloc + $500k of copy capital is a very different position — the router must cap copied notional to
venue limits and split across markets/venues if needed. This is the copy layer's analogue of the pool's `K`
ceiling.

**Risks specific to copy:** adverse selection (copiers pile into a hot trader right before mean-reversion —
mitigate with track-record minimums + the same drawdown stop on copy positions); mirror-execution atomicity
(must be one-tx or copiers eat slippage); venue concentration (cap exposure per trader/market/venue).

## 5. Risk bounds
- **Floor:** start tier 2, minimal base allocation — caps fluke-pass extraction.
- **Ceiling:** hard max allocation per trader + global funded cap (`MAX_FUNDED_TRADERS`) — bounds pool risk.
- **Drawdown stop** on the live Avantis position, enforced by the keeper.
- **Pool buffer:** retain a USDC reserve to absorb venue-level / liquidation tail risk.
- **Venue risk:** perp protocols carry smart-contract + liquidation + keeper-liveness risk (cf. Drift
  exploit). Diversify venues over time; cap exposure per venue.

## 6. Contract changes (diff plan — for sign-off)
0. ✅ **DONE — role split (`feat(contract): split GUARDIAN`).** `GUARDIAN` immutable owns `setPaused`;
   `TREASURY` keeps fees + `addFeeds` + cert owner. Deploy scripts take treasury/guardian via env. The
   keeper stays a roleless EOA. 104 tests pass; `test_Pause_OnlyGuardian` asserts even TREASURY can't pause.
1. **Live-tier gate** — replace `leverage > f.lastLevel` check with `leverage > _leverageLevel(f.cumulativePnl)`; keep `lastLevel` for NFTs only.
2. **Allocation scaling** — `_effectiveCap` / margin sizing scales with `tierMultiplier(cumulativePnl)`.
3. **Promotion gate** — track trades-at-tier + drawdown-clean flag; require both for step-up; demote/terminate on breach.
4. **`IFundedVenue` interface** + `AvantisAdapter` (Base) wired behind a feature flag; `PropFund` stays synthetic unless enabled.
5. **Eval fee** — add a configurable fee (default $1) collected on eval start; revenue to treasury/pool.
6. Tests: bidirectional scaling, demotion on loss, promotion-gate enforcement, adapter open/close, fee accounting.

> ⚠️ **EIP-170 budget is now critical: 24,570 / 24,576 — only 6 bytes spare** (the GUARDIAN split cost 62).
> The remaining items (1–5) WILL overflow. Reclaim space first — likely by moving the funded-venue logic
> into the `AvantisAdapter` / router (keeping `PropFund` thin) rather than inlining it. Budget this before
> writing items 1–5.

## 7. Open decisions
- **Up/down rates** — keep the existing $50/$150/$400/$1000 PnL thresholds, or recalibrate for allocation scaling?
- **`baseAllocation`** starting size and **max allocation** ceiling.
- **Profit split** — the model needs a *tiered* split (50→85% trader) to hit a realistic ~9 bps break-even.
  Confirm the schedule; decide if integrator rebates go to pool or are shared.
- **Drawdown stop type** — **trailing-from-high-water** (pool-favorable, ~100% eventual ruin, fast capital
  recycle) vs. **fixed floor** (winners survive, better trader UX, slower recycle → longer waitlist). This is
  the single biggest lever on both pool EV *and* the queue.
- **Pool size `K` + max-allocation ceiling** — sets the utilization/wait trade-off (see §4.6 table).
- **Eval fee token** — USDC $1, or ETH-equivalent? Refundable on pass (some firms refund the fee to passers)?
- **Termination vs. demotion** on first drawdown breach — hard cut or one-tier demote with a strike system?
- **Testnet-first** Avantis (Base Sepolia availability TBD) vs. straight to a capped mainnet pilot.
- **Copy layer (§4.7):** DAO scope/governance, copy-eligibility tier, per-trader copy cap, the copy fee
  waterfall (trader / DAO / LP / integrator), and how copied notional is capped to venue OI/profit limits.
- ~~**Treasury/admin role split**~~ ✅ done (§6.0) — `TREASURY` (fees) and `GUARDIAN` (pause) are now
  separate immutables; production sets distinct addresses, keeper is roleless. Decide the actual production
  addresses (DAO multisig for TREASURY, ops multisig for GUARDIAN) at redeploy.

*Eval stays virtual and custody-free. Funded capital flows only toward demonstrated, rule-abiding
performance, bounded at every step — which is what lets the eval fee be $1.*
